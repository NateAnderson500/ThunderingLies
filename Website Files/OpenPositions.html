                I have need of a writer and programmer. (none of this is paid by the way, I am poor)<br><br>

                For the programmer, I would prefer someone who has take at least the equivilant of Data Structures for Java,<br>
                but if you can show that you know what you are doing, then I would consider it. <br><br>

                For the writer, If yout show me some work and I like it, then I would consider you for the job <br><br>

                Again this is unpaid due to me just being in college and not having money to actually hire people
