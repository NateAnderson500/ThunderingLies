Thundering Lies: A game by Nate Anderson, Paul Brouillette, Tinu Thomas, Andrew Knoll, and Matthew Quinn.

Thundering Lies is a game that Nate has been working on for the past 6 or so months. This will be the focused on the backend/core features of the game, and thus will not be a complete game, but will showcase the core features and mechanics of the game.
The game will follow a similar format to the classic Fallout series, but with our own twist on the UI elements, and with more focus on the text-based descision making process.

All of the individual tasks and where they are in their development can be found in Projects -> Thundering Lies

Our goals are as follows:

1. We would like to have the solar system fully modeled and for the player to be abel to travel to any of the planets in the solar system.

2. All of the space stations will be modeled, and the player will be able to travel/enter to any of the stations

3. there will be 3 to 5 missions available to showcase some of the games features.

4. Basic mining functionality will be added to the game, and the player will be able to mine asteroids for resources.

5. Basic combat will be added to the game, and the player will be able to fight enemies.

6. Invintory will be added to the game, and the player will be able to store items in their ship's inventory.
