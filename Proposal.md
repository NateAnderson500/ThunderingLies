Thundering Lies: A game by Nate Anderson, Paul Brouillette, Tinu Thomas, Andrew Knoll, and Matthew Quinn.

Thundering Lies is a game that Nate has been working on for the past 6 or so months. This will be the focused on the backend/core features of the game, and thus will not be a complete game, but will showcase the core features and mechanics of the game.
The game will follow a similar format to the classic Fallout series, but with our own twist on the UI elements, and with more focus on the text-based descision making process.

All of the individual tasks and where they are in their development can be found in Projects -> Thundering Lies
